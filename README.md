# My Personal Project : Personal Finance Tracker

## Project Proposal
The **Personal Finance Tracker** is a desktop application designed to help users effectively manage their expenses. This application allows users to record and categorize their daily expenses and income, track savings goals and generate basic reports that can help visualize spending patterns. Users can categorize their transactions (like food, rent, services, entertainment etc.), view monthly summaries and do tasks such as setting targets for savings, all while maintaining a clear record of their financial history. The application should have a fully functioning GUI by the end of the term.

This application is intended for people who want a simple but effective tool to manage their personal finances. It is particularly useful for people who want to improve their financial habits by understanding how their money is used every month and setting financial goals to propogate healthy spending habits.

This project interests me because personal finance management is something me and many of my friends often struggle with. Building financial management skills is very important as an adult. Developing this application allows me to combine my interest for computer science with a real-world problem that affects many people. Creating this tool will also give me insight into the challenge of designing a flexible, user-friendly model while gaining insight into Java's Object oriented features.
